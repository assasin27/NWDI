# Memory Management System

## Overview
This document outlines the memory management system used in the Nareshwadi Products e-commerce platform. The system is designed to maintain context, document decisions, and track the project's evolution over time, including the full range of Nareshwadi products.

## Purpose
- Maintain project context across conversations
- Document architectural decisions
- Track project evolution
- Provide reference for onboarding new team members
- Ensure consistency in development

## Memory Types

### 1. Project Overview
- **Purpose**: High-level project documentation
- **Contents**:
  - Current state and features
  - Technical stack
  - Future considerations
  - Implementation status

### 2. Database Schema
- **Purpose**: Detailed data model documentation
- **Contents**:
  - Database tables and relationships
  - Model definitions
  - Field specifications
  - Relationship mappings

## How It Works
1. **Automatic Context**: The system automatically references relevant memories during conversations.
2. **Manual Updates**: Key information is manually added to ensure accuracy.
3. **Versioning**: Memories are timestamped and can be updated as the project evolves.

## Best Practices
1. **Update Frequency**:
   - After major feature implementations
   - When architectural decisions are made
   - When adding new components or services

2. **Content Guidelines**:
   - Be concise but thorough
   - Include rationale for important decisions
   - Document known limitations or technical debt
   - Update outdated information promptly

## Accessing Memories
Memories can be accessed through the following methods:
1. **Direct Queries**: Ask specific questions about the project
2. **Automatic Recall**: The system will reference relevant memories automatically
3. **Documentation**: Key memories are documented in the project's documentation

## Maintenance
- Regularly review and update memories
- Remove or archive outdated information
- Ensure consistency across related memories
